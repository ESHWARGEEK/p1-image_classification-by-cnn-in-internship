# P1-image_classification-by-cnn-in-internship
this project will clasify the images using convolution neural network by using streamlit
in the aicte internship i have created an image classification machine learning model trained on cifar10 dataset 
in this project we are training our model with cifar10 10,000 images which is in the "model_training code.py"
and we get cnn_model.h5 file which is the trained model which we have got from model_training.py
we are using the trained model to predict the images in future
